        // If you know table views, it should immediately jump out at you, that this doesn't take into account a classic mistake when using table view:
        // forgetting to call "reloadData".  The displayed cells in a table view are only synced with what the dataSource provides when a call to reloadData
        // occurs.  We're "lucky" in this sample app, because the dataSource is loaded up with data before the tableview is created and wired up.  The automatic
        // "reloadData" that occurs at the very beginning is sufficient.  But if we had dynamic data, this would no longer be good enough.  A reliable test would
        // have to take calls to "reloadData" into account.  One way to do this is to create a subclass of UITableView for use in tests only, and make sure it gets
        // injected during the test.  This subclass will override "reloadData" to do exactly what we're doing here: call the dataSource to grab the number of rows/sections
        // and retrieve all the associated cells.  The subclass can then store this as a property called, say, "currentlyDisplayedCells".  The test will simply query
        // this property.  This way, since "currentlyDisplayedCells" only gets updated when "reloadData" is called, this will more closely mimic the real behavior of a
        // table view.  Note that this is necessary because a more "direct" test by examining the view hierarchy has its own problems, due to the cell reuse behavior of table views.
        // We aren't, however, testing that reuse behavior.  We trust Apple and assume the reuse logic places views in the hierarchy "correctly".  What does "correctly" mean?
        // Well (unless you're using animated batch updates), it means the cells equal what the dataSource says, when "reloadData" is called.  It is that definition of "correct"
        // that we're trying to capture when we replace parts of UIKit with test doubles, or attempt to mimic parts of its behavior in our tests.
